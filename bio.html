  With a Heritage in Herbal medicine, Rosemary’s initial passion was evident as a young child, feeling the strong connection with plants, the earth, animals and compassion for the welfare of our planet. With a passionate interest in herbal medicines and traditional methods of healing of her European ancestors, and that of cultures worldwide, it seemed a natural progression to become a dedicated professional Herbalist and Naturopath, a discipline that combines both ancient Western and Eastern health philosophies.
