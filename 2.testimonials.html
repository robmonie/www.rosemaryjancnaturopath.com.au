    “I visited Rosemary after my 4th major spinal/nerve operation for speeding up recovery and muscular stiffness. She prescribed me some tonics and nutritional supplements, which gave me immediate relief. I only wish I had gone to her sooner after my previous operations!” <strong>A.M- Williamstown</strong>

  “Rosemary, you inspire me with your intuition and integrity within your profession. Never have I witnessed such a love of the herbs that you dispense and knowledge of herb law. Your broad knowledge of nature’s pharmacy is instrumental in the success of my own personal healings. Not only are you an insightful healer, but also a great teacher. I feel privileged to have met you and the opportunity to praise your gifts and service to humanity.” <strong>Nijole, Brunswick</strong>

  “I would like to say a very big thank you for all your support, compassion, care and nurture! You were always so warm and willing to share your wisdom and knowledge. I liked it how you always had a nice warm herbal tea waiting for me when I arrived, it really alleviated the stress and reminded me to practice better self-care myself. Your knowledge of herbs and nutrition really helped me balance my emotional rollercoasters. Thank-you for your enthusiasm, caring and generous spirit. I have missed your since moving interstate, if i move back i will definitely come and see you again.” <strong>Adrienne, Tas</strong>

  “After my 34th birthday, I decided to make some immediate changes. I visited Rosemary and expressed to her things I wanted to change, Rosemary was very helpful and so understanding in her approach. One herbal tonic later (not bottles of tablets) and simple life style changes I felt fantastic inside and out, so much so that I was asked if I had facial surgery.
  Since then I have visited Rosemary for serious related issues and found the best way is the natural way. What I value the most is the care Rose has for her patients, it is not just confined to a visit. Rosemary will often email or call with information that will benefit me. Following Rosemary’s advice I feel great.” <strong>J.D Melbourne</strong>

  “Rosemary has been able to help me greatly in a holistic way. With her strong intuitive abilities, she knew what was really going on with me long before I had any idea. She is also very generous with sharing her knowledge and time and has helped me work through my health issues in a sensible and compassionate way. I would gladly recommend Rosemary to anyone, as I have always found her advice to be helpful, sound and ultimately correct (although I have not always listened to it at first  ). Most of all, she empowers you to look after your own health rather than to become reliant on therapies etc unless it is necessary.” – <strong>N. Melbourne</strong>

  “GO AND SEE ROSEMARY, SHE’S FANTASTIC! She’s very knowledgeable across a range of different modalities and combines these to create a holistic approach tailored to suit. She is a warm and inviting person and her treatment room is serene and comfortable. I’ve always found her advice and products to be extremely accurate and helpful with both physical and emotional difficulties. I love that she uses diet suggestions along with her products, so unlike some naturopaths, you don’t leave with a million things to take and having spent a small fortune. I also love that Rosemary really takes the time with each of her clients, you absolutely feel like her only priority, and you never feel like you’re being pushed out the door. Oh, and she also makes fabulous herbal tea!” <strong>D.S. Mitcham</strong>
