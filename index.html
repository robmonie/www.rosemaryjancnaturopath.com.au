    <h2>Therapies</h2>
    <h3>Herbal Medicine</h3>
    <p>Herbs are able to support &amp; nourish specific systems of the body. Using Traditional &amp; modern herbal medicine principles and skilled techniques. Top quality practitioner-only liquid extracts (incl alcohol free range), handmade herbal tinctures, infusions, fresh and dry herbs.</p>

    <h3>Nutrition &amp; Food as Medicine</h3>
    <p>The body needs the correct levels of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and water to maintain life and healthy function. If for any reason these reach compromising levels, you may need to supplement &amp;/or re-assess your diet. Using the principles of Food as Medicine to help nourish and support you. Zinc level testing is included.</p>
    <h3>Bespoke Natural Skincare</h3>
    <p>I’ll work with you to craft a solution specific to your skin’s needs. Made from quality practitioner only essential oils by “Essential Therapeutics”, herbal extracts and natural key nutrients for the skin.</p>
    <h3>Aura &amp; Chakra Balance</h3>
    <p>Nurturing your spirit, body &amp; mind is integral to good health. A traditional hands-on healing method, that works with your Auric field &amp; chakra centres. Incorporating meditation / relaxation techniques, Aura-Soma, crystal and Flower Essence Therapy</p>
    <h3>Flower Essences</h3>
    <p>Flower essences are a vibrational extract of Flowers, not used directly for physical conditions but for varying emotional states. Flower essences are safe to use and have no side effects. I use Australian Bush Flowers, Bach flowers &amp; Californian F.E.S</p>
